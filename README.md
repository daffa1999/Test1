* Marketing is very importent in any business. It can make company grow and sustainable. Good customer segmentaion can engage customers well, grow revenue and incarease sales.
* By understanding customers needs, the marketers can lauch targeted marketing campaign that specific to customers.
* The example data can be gotten from https://www.kaggle.com/arjunbhasin2013/ccdata. 
* K-Means is used for clustering some data points in unsupervised algorithm.
* Autoencoders and PCA is also usued to make best customer segmentarion models.
# Project 2: Sales Forcasting
* Sales forcasting is needed by comapany to make thier sales growth and can compete with other company.
* The data is gotten from https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data.

* Facebook prophet is used to produce forcasting time series data.
* It work well for data that contain strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data.
# Project 3: Chest Disease Classifier
* Classifying chest disease with deep learning can make it automated and reduce cost and time to detect disease.
* The X-Ray chest data can be used to develop a model that could detect and classify the diseases in short time.
* The data contain four category, it is healthy, covid-19, bacterial pheumonia, viral pneumonia
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used to extract features and perform classification.
* RESNET and transfer learning are also used to make model better and faster.
